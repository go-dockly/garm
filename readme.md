`gARM彡` is a compiler for ARM64 assembly combining Go's simplicity with low-level control and high performance. Offering optimizations, hardware-level tuning, security controls, debugging tools, and more for the avid hacker.
We love our gopher more than anything it's always been a loyal companion protecting and providing us.

## `૮( OᴗO)っ` Philosophy

While there are many Go compilers and ARM assemblers, there's a gap in the market for tools that specifically optimize Go code for ARM's unique features such as:

- ARM's flexible second operand in arithmetic instructions
- Conditional execution capabilities
- NEON SIMD operations for vectorization
- Hardware divide and multiply-accumulate instructions

### Market Timing 

With the rising dominance of ARM architecture (Apple M-series, AWS Graviton, mobile devices, embedded systems), having tools that can optimize specifically for ARM64 is becoming increasingly important.

### Engineering

- (AST) -> (SSA) -> (IR) -> (Optimizer) -> (Assembly)

## `ദ്ദി(˵•̀ᴗ -˵)ᕤ` Road map

- gARM彡 by default compiles with Generational GC
- Offer choice between [GC algoritms](docs/gc.md) or none
- High-performance computing on ARM servers (5x go performance on ARM64)
- Cross platform mobile / embedded systems where performance is critical
- Cloud applications running on ARM instances
